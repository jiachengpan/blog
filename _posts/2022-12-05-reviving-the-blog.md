It's been a while since last time I sat down and write a complete post here, though I am pretty active writing notes here - in another page.

In this _while_ of more than 3 years, I joined [Enflame](https://www.enflame-tech.com), writing simulation models and analytical models, expanding my vision from a unit level SM arch to an SOC level arch along with something else to focus for customers and users.
I met lots of people, and gradually developed my guts to discuss and talk with confidence. Lots of people left, with myself continuing the work of building an efficient framework and models for architecture exploration and optimisations. That is painful, seeing friends leaving. But it's not yet time for me to stop as I have a target to hit.

As said, many submodules of this architecture exploration framework has been developed. The experience therein is invaluable - it's a brand new experience to propose a brand new tool, a new idea, and a path no one is competing with you - and not so many lessons from others.

Since it's been a while, plus I haven't practised serious writings for a long time, I am reviving this blog to take notes of the thoughts - in a more complete format, instead of fragments scattered in diary notes.

So ... let's see.
