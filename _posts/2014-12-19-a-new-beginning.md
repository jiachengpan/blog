This is my first diary here.

In fact, I have always been willing to keep diary, and I indeed did years ago. But then, I gradually gave up, due to many reasons.

Not until yesterday, when I read a co-worker's homepage, I then realised that I do need to collect my good habit back -- 
to better know what I have done everyday, and to better feel the life I am wasting.

Years ago, when keeping diary, I always selected the notebook I used carefully -- how the papers needed to be, in terms of the thickness, the colour, and the lines printed should look like;
and the cover was also very important, which should be of my faviourite colour, or should be made of very special material, which should have a comfortable feeling to touch.  
And I used pens with dark-blue ink, which always gives me a moderate feeling -- black is too dark whereas blue too light.

Now, I am still picking about the theme... :sunglasses: And muan's theme is just matching my taste, which I am happily forking and using now.

Finally, I just hope the future contents in this new 'book' shall be as meaningful as my life should be, and a very good memory of a future me.
