##### Day XXXII, 2nd, May

Mailied.

So this is the beginning of the diary for the second month of unemployment.

I wish it would be delightful month, so I decided to use Goethe's poem *Mailied*, which presents a delightful scene of May, to be the keyword of the very first post.

<br>

So. New beginning. I would say that the May shall be of a very different style -- I mainly focused on pet project writing without thinking of too much about practical interviews, but now, I AM prepraring specifically for the interviews and specifically the programming ones.
Going forward, the style shall continue, until I got an offer of satisfactory.

The experience is very much different from the project doing, while I sometimes feel that I gain more than project doing from practising small problems.
I think this to some extent makes sense -- this is as if I am eating fine rices, as the small problems are merits and fundamentals of advanced composite problems.
But I need to be aware that eating too much rice isn't good for my health -- I need to dine crops like grains and corns which are of coarse quality, which are as project doing which makes my stomach even more robust.

*(Errr... what am I talking about...*

OK. Let the play begin.

##### Day XXXIII, 3rd, May

Practise and Review.

More leetcode problems. I find myself more proficient in handling backtracking and DP problems -- it might be a good way to practise by tags :smile:

And just started to read the book *advanced linux programming* to review relevant knowledge. Thought not very thick, this book illustrates many key points well.

Another thing is that I reviewed some interview sharing in 1point3acres, for companies like NVIDIA and UBER... Well, I need to do better in lower-level knowledge... (and that's why I started to read the book aforementioned!!
