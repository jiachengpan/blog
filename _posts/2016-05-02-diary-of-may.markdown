##### Day XXXII, 2nd, May

Mailied.

So this is the beginning of the diary for the second month of unemployment.

I wish it would be delightful month, so I decided to use Goethe's poem *Mailied*, which presents a delightful scene of May, to be the keyword of the very first post.

<br>

So. New beginning. I would say that the May shall be of a very different style -- I mainly focused on pet project writing without thinking of too much about practical interviews, but now, I AM prepraring specifically for the interviews and specifically the programming ones.
Going forward, the style shall continue, until I got an offer of satisfactory.

The experience is very much different from the project doing, while I sometimes feel that I gain more than project doing from practising small problems.
I think this to some extent makes sense -- this is as if I am eating fine rices, as the small problems are merits and fundamentals of advanced composite problems.
But I need to be aware that eating too much rice isn't good for my health -- I need to dine crops like grains and corns which are of coarse quality, which are as project doing which makes my stomach even more robust.

*(Errr... what am I talking about...*

OK. Let the play begin.

##### Day XXXIII, 3rd, May

Practise and Review.

More leetcode problems. I find myself more proficient in handling backtracking and DP problems -- it might be a good way to practise by tags :smile:

And just started to read the book *advanced linux programming* to review relevant knowledge. Thought not very thick, this book illustrates many key points well.

Another thing is that I reviewed some interview sharing in 1point3acres, for companies like NVIDIA and UBER... Well, I need to do better in lower-level knowledge... (and that's why I started to read the book aforementioned!!

##### Day XXXIV, 4th, May

Youth.

I wish I were still a youth, while according to the definition of the UN, 24 is the upperbound. Alas!!

---

Just finished the first section (5 chapters) of the *Advanced Linux Programming*. Really comprehensive. Looking forward to getting more out of it reading the following chapters.

And leetcode-on -- today's topic is mostly Graph -- simple, when I know the approach, and elegant, when I know that the problem can be modeled as graph.
Besides, I am also starting to do string problems, which is really a big chunk. I feel that string problems are mostly not difficult, but really tricky and challenges my carefulness.

So it's been a few days without hearing any updates from my delivered resumes. Time to further fill the queue.

##### Day XXXV, 5th, May

Sent.

Not very productive today in terms of code writing -- I put most effort on reviewing computer architecture.

Finally I have made a decision to try Compute Architect. I am not sure I can get it, but at least I have made it clear to myself -- I am not going to yield to remain being a tester.
I need to and will jump out of the comfort zone to embrace the world of challenging.

And I am considering applying for even more positions of the companies that I was not that fond of. Lacking of interview responses makes me anxious.

##### Day XXXVI, 6th, May

Computer Architecture

Continuing reviewing. Nothing special, except that I got a call from AMD and scheduled an interview next week while no further details were provided from their side.
Not sure if there would be any update later... I understand that I may not be a good fit for verification as I did not have relevant experience. But I wish to have a try anyway.

Also just realised that [this course](https://www.coursera.org/course/comparch) is essentially following the *Computer Architecture -- a Quantitative Approach*.
OK. Two days being reviewing the book... And old memories (not only the days taking the princeton course, but also the colledge days...) came into my mind...

I think I deserve an interview...

BTW. I eventually applied for a router RnD position in CDNS. Back to the origin... Wish this would be my last stand...

Something saw today:

The flowers in Xi Garden blooms. I wish I could be settled before they die.
And they really resemble the ones I used to keep, though they are gone forever, with my premature emotion.

##### Day XXXIX, 9th, May

AMD.

After reviewing computer architecture for two days, which are irrelevant to today's interview, I went to AMD for an interview.

It was just plain and simple technically. But the hiring manager's concern really surprised me -- he was concerned about my current unemployment status -- quitting before finding a job.

He just doesnt believe that my reason for leaving is simply a feeling of lack of challenging. 
He believes that job is only possibly challenging to NCGs, while for senior persons, they have experiences and they are *supposed* to do / be accepted to do what they already have been doing.
And he thinks that working is simply a means of living, and has nothing to do with *interest* -- one can do more about his interests after work, and maybe apply his after-work knowledge to work sometimes if possible. But work is equal to interest? No.

I had to say that I disagreed with him about all these points of view, and kept saying my reason for leave.

I am not sure if this was his real thinking, or it was merely a pretending stress test.
If it was real, I have to reconsider if I really want to report to him, though from his thorough description this position is very much to my interest. 
(and he was the second interviewing manager I have ever encountered who deliberately and thoroughly elaborate the position. For this I appreciate his effort.)

Anyway... This is merely less than half-way. I need to continue working on leetcode and CA.
