Hello!!

My name is Jiacheng Pan (潘佳诚). ([CV](/files/jiacheng_pan.pdf))

I am a staff engineer focusing on deep learning accelerator architecture design, exploration, and modeling in [Enflame](http://www.enflame-tech.com/). \\
Before joining Enflame, I was an SM architect in [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/) (2017.5-2019.9), an ASIC enginner in [AMD](https://www.amd.com) (2016.6-2017.5), and a SW enginner in [SNPS](https://synopsys.com) (2013.2-2016.5)

"I love waves, winds, and storms, everything almost, which is Nature's, and may be untainted by Men's misery."

Besides, my interest includes computer architecture, high performance computing, and computer aided design.

Cheers, \\
Jiacheng Pan
