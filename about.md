Hello!!

My name is Jiacheng Pan (潘佳诚). \\
I am an engineer focusing on chip architecture design and modeling in [Enflame](http://www.enflame-tech.com/). \\
Before joining Enflame, I was an SM architect in [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/) (2017.5-2019.9), an ASIC enginner in [AMD](https://www.amd.com) (2016.6-2017.5), and a SW enginner in [SNPS](https://synopsys.com) (2013.2-2016.5)

"I love waves, winds, and storms, everything almost, which is Nature's, and may be untainted by Men's misery."

Besides, my interests focus on computer architecture, high performance computing, and CAD.

Cheers,
Jiacheng Pan
