Hi!!

My name is Jiacheng Pan (潘佳诚). \\
I am an engineer focusing on chip architecture design and modeling.

I like the Doctor and TARDIS, and many other things in nature🐾🦄🦅. \\
(though I am mostly constrained in office😅)

I always want to be a good writer, \\
but sites like this are usually lack of my care.

So... Enjoy... 🐼
