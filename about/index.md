Hi!! :smile:

My name is Jiacheng Pan(潘佳诚).

I love solving problems, learning languages, and learning new ideas.
<br><br>

Currently I am an R&D engineer in Synopsys, focusing on testing CTS-related functions in IC Compiler II.

Some of my pet projects are uploaded as [Github repositories](http://github.com/jiachengpan).
<br><br>

Following are some details about me. Welcome to reach me by commenting below!

<br>
Cheers, <br>
Jiacheng :panda_face:

Experience
----------
February 2013 - Present
: **[Synopsys, Inc.](http://synopsys.com)** *R&D Engineer*

    * Focus on software black-box testing and testing automation,
    on **CTS**-related (Clock Tree Synthesis) functionalities of *[IC Compiler II](https://www.synopsys.com/Tools/Implementation/PhysicalImplementation/Pages/ICCompilerII.aspx)*, the next-generation P&R tool;
    * Test basic and advanced features of **CTS** and **CCD** (Concurrent Clock-Data optimization);
        * Plan test scenarios, setup test suites, analyse QoR (Quality of Result) (including clock skew, timing slack, clock routing topology, floorplan, etc.), classify outliers and failures, and report bugs;
    * Maintain test regressions and regular QoR monitoring;
        * Own ~1k regression cases, 2 QoR-monitoring suites;
    * Develop testing harnesses, design searcher, case builder, and test data analyzer;
        * Initiated and own ~10k lines of CTS testing harnesses used among CTS team and other teams as well;
        * Initiated the development of a test data analyser using data mining techniques;
    * Mentored summer-intern and new hirer of CTS team;
    * Active participant and lecturer of an internal Python study group.
    * Awarded:
        * STAR Award (2015)
        * Excellent Mentor Award (2016)
