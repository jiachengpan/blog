Hi!! :smile:

My name is Jiacheng Pan(潘佳诚).

I love solving problems, learning languages, and learning new ideas.
<br><br>

Currently I am an R&D engineer in Synopsys, focusing on testing CTS-related functions in IC Compiler II.

Some of my pet projects are uploaded as [Github repositories](http://github.com/jiachengpan).
<br><br>

Following are some details about me. Welcome to reach me by commenting below!

<br>
Cheers, <br>
Jiacheng :panda_face:
