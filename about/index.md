#### [PDF Resume](/about/jiacheng-pan.pdf)

Hi!! :smile:

My name is Jiacheng Pan(潘佳诚).

I love solving problems, learning languages, and learning new ideas.
<br><br>

I am an Design Engineer in AMD, focusing on in-house EDA tool software development, involving design stitching, verificaton, and simulation code generation, as well as low-power design generation.

Before joining AMD, I worked as an R&D engineer in Synopsys for ~3 years, focusing on software testing development and testing CTS-related functions in IC Compiler II.

My recent interests are:
<p></p>
* EDA algorithms
* high-performance computing, in particular for machine learning
* system programming


Some of my pet projects are uploaded as [Github repositories](http://github.com/jiachengpan).
<br><br>

Following are some details about me. Welcome to shoot me a mail or commenting below!

<br>
Cheers, <br>
Jiacheng :panda_face:
